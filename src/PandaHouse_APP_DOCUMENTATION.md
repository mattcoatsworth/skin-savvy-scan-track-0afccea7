# PandaHouse App Documentation

## Overview

PandaHouse is a comprehensive holistic skin health platform that combines modern science with traditional wellness practices. The application helps users track, analyze and improve their skin health through personalized recommendations, energy analysis, and daily tracking features.

## Core Features

### Energy Analysis

#### Holistic Image Analysis
The Energy Analysis feature allows users to upload a selfie for metaphysical and energetic interpretation:

- **Technology**: Powered by OpenAI's GPT-4o vision model
- **Analysis Frameworks**: Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), chakra systems, and emotion-body maps
- **Purpose**: Provides insights into the energetic meaning of skin conditions rather than medical diagnosis
- **Integration**: Analyzes personal skin logs when available to provide more personalized insights

#### Implementation Details
- **Image Processing**: Securely processes user-uploaded images with privacy safeguards
- **User Interface**: Clean, intuitive interface with image preview, upload controls, and results display
- **Data Integration**: Combines image analysis with user's historical skin data when available
- **Context Awareness**: Adapts to different usage contexts (standalone vs. within skin logging workflow)

### Onboarding Flow

#### Dynamic Progress Bar
The onboarding flow features a responsive progress bar that:
- Shows the user's current position in the multi-step onboarding process
- Updates automatically as users advance through screens
- Calculates progress percentage based on current step and total steps
- Uses a smooth transition animation when advancing between steps

#### Gender-Specific Customization
When a user selects their gender during onboarding:

**Male Selection:**
- Automatically skips the menstrual cycle question in the onboarding sequence
- Sets default theme to "Summer" (stored in localStorage)
- Removes gender-specific UI elements from the entire app including:
  - Makeup cards in the daily logging interface
  - Menstrual cycle tracking cards in the daily logging interface
- Maintains the same step count in the progress bar for a seamless experience

**Female Selection:**
- Includes complete onboarding flow with menstrual cycle questions
- Displays all tracking options including makeup and menstrual cycle cards

This gender-based customization is implemented through conditional rendering throughout the app, with state persisted in localStorage for consistency across sessions.

### "Ask a Question" Chat Integration

#### Dynamic Chat Interface
The "Ask a Question" chat component that appears at the bottom of recommendation detail pages features:

- **Context-Aware Placeholders**: The input field's placeholder text automatically adapts to the current page's topic
- **Quick Suggestion Pills**: Horizontal scrollable suggestion buttons with common questions related to skin health
- **Visual Scroll Indicators**: Gradient fade effects with chevron icons indicate when more suggestions are available
- **Seamless Navigation**: When a user submits a question, they're directed to the full chat interface with their question pre-populated

#### Implementation Details
- The component accepts a `productTitle` prop that dynamically changes the placeholder text
- Questions are routed to the AI chat page with the initial query preserved in the navigation state
- Suggestion pills provide one-click access to common questions about the current topic
- The same component can be reused across different product and recommendation pages while maintaining contextual awareness

#### User Flow
1. User views a recommendation detail 
2. The chat box displays with contextual placeholder text
3. User can either:
   - Type a custom question about the topic
   - Click a suggestion pill for a pre-formulated question
4. Upon submission, user is directed to the full chat interface with their question ready for AI response

### Rating System

#### Overview
PandaHouse uses a comprehensive rating system (0-100 scale) to evaluate products, activities, and skin conditions. This standardized approach provides users with clear, actionable insights across the app.

#### Rating Scale Design
- **0-19**: Poor compatibility/effect (Red indicators)
- **20-39**: Fair compatibility/effect (Orange-red indicators)
- **40-59**: OK compatibility/effect (Yellow indicators)
- **60-79**: Good compatibility/effect (Light green indicators)
- **80-100**: Excellent compatibility/effect (Bright green indicators)

#### Visual Design Elements
- **Circular Progress Indicators**: Used throughout the app to display ratings with color-coded progress rings
- **Background Colors**: Light versions (20% opacity) of the main color provide subtle context
- **Label System**: Each numeric rating includes a text label (Poor, Fair, OK, Good, Great)
- **Personalization**: "For You" badge appears when the rating is personalized to the user

#### Rating Sources
1. **General Ratings**: Based on scientific research and ingredient analysis
2. **Personalized Ratings**: Modified based on user's skin type, concerns, and historical data
3. **Impact Analysis**: Products and activities are categorized as having "Positive," "Neutral," or "Negative" impact

#### Rating Calculation
Ratings are derived from multiple factors:
- Ingredient safety profiles from regulatory databases
- Scientific research on effectiveness for skin health
- Aggregate user reporting from our community
- Personalized factors based on your skin type and concerns
- Historical skin log correlations

## Design System

### Insights & Trends Badge Design

## Getting Started

### Environment Setup

The application requires these environmental variables:

- **OPENAI_API_KEY**: For AI-powered recommendations and analysis
- **SUPABASE_URL**: Connection to the Supabase backend
- **SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY**: For authorized backend operations
- **SUPABASE_ANON_KEY**: For client-side Supabase operations

### Local Development

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`
3. Set up environment variables
4. Start the development server with `npm run dev`
5. Access the application at `localhost:5173`

## Best Practices

### Performance Optimization

- Image uploads are compressed client-side before transmission
- AI requests use caching to minimize redundant API calls
- User data is paginated to minimize initial load times

### Security Considerations

- User images are processed securely and not permanently stored
- API keys are properly secured in environment variables
- Database access is controlled through row-level security policies

### Accessibility
