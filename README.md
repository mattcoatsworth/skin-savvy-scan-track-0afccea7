## Rating System

### Overview
Skin Savvy uses a comprehensive rating system (0-100 scale) to evaluate products, activities, and skin conditions. This standardized approach provides users with clear, actionable insights across the app.

### Rating Scale Design
- **0-19**: Poor compatibility/effect (Red indicators)
- **20-39**: Fair compatibility/effect (Orange-red indicators)
- **40-59**: OK compatibility/effect (Yellow indicators)
- **60-79**: Good compatibility/effect (Light green indicators)
- **80-100**: Excellent compatibility/effect (Bright green indicators)

### Visual Design Elements
- **Circular Progress Indicators**: Used throughout the app to display ratings with color-coded progress rings
- **Background Colors**: Light versions (20% opacity) of the main color provide subtle context
- **Label System**: Each numeric rating includes a text label (Poor, Fair, OK, Good, Great)
- **Personalization**: "For You" badge appears when the rating is personalized to the user

### Rating Sources
1. **General Ratings**: Based on scientific research and ingredient analysis
2. **Personalized Ratings**: Modified based on user's skin type, concerns, and historical data
3. **Impact Analysis**: Products and activities are categorized as having "Positive," "Neutral," or "Negative" impact

### Rating Calculation
Ratings are derived from multiple factors:
- Ingredient safety profiles from regulatory databases
- Scientific research on effectiveness for skin health
- Aggregate user reporting from our community
- Personalized factors based on your skin type and concerns
- Historical skin log correlations

The rating system integrates with both the OpenAI API (for personalized recommendations and analysis) and TogetherAI API (for interactive chat experiences) to provide comprehensive skin health insights.
