React Native-Only Codebase Rule
Whenever you:
Add a new feature, page, or screen
Add or update dependencies
Refactor or migrate existing code
You must:
Use only React Native components, APIs, and libraries compatible with React Native/iOS.
Do NOT use web-only React components, browser APIs (such as window, document, or localStorage), or libraries that require a browser environment.
Ensure all code is tested in a React Native/iOS simulator or device.
Reference the React Native documentation for supported APIs and components.
Pull requests must not introduce any web-only code or dependencies.

### 1. **Install Dependencies**
First, ensure all dependencies are installed. In your terminal, run:
```sh
cd ~/Documents/SkinAI/SkinSavvy
npm install
```

### 2. **Start Expo**
After dependencies are installed, start the Expo development server:
```sh
npx expo start
```
Wait for the Metro Bundler to fully start (you'll see a QR code and options in the terminal).

### 3. **Open the iOS Simulator**
Once Expo is running, press the `i` key in the terminal window where Expo is running. This should launch the iOS simulator and install your app.
