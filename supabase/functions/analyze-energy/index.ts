There's a subtle glow emanating from your skin that suggests good qi circulation. 
The areas around your cheeks show signs of heart chakra activation, while your forehead 
indicates strong third-eye energy. Your skin's natural luminosity points to a well-balanced 
root chakra providing grounding energy to your entire system.

Some areas around your jawline suggest minor energy blockages that might be related to 
unexpressed communication or emotions. A gentle practice of throat chakra meditation 
could help clear these subtle imbalances. Overall, your skin's energetic pattern shows 
remarkable resilience and a natural ability to self-regulate its vital force.`;
